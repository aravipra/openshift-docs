{product-title-first} provides developers and IT organizations with small-form-factor and edge computing delivered as an application that customers can deploy on top of their managed {op-system-base-full} devices at the edge. Built on {OCP} and Kubernetes, {microshift-short} provides an efficient way to operate single-node clusters in low-resource edge environments.

{microshift-short} is designed to make control plane restarts economical and be lifecycle-managed as a single unit by the operating system. Updates, roll-backs, and configuration changes consist of simply staging another version in parallel and then - without relying on a network - flipping to and from that version and restarting.

[id="microshift-4-18-rhel-image-mode_{context}"]
=== {op-system-base-full} image mode Technology Preview feature
* You can install {microshift-short} using a `bootc` container image. Image mode for {op-system-base} is a Technology Preview deployment method that uses a container-native approach to build, deploy and manage the operating system as a bootc container image.

See xref:../microshift_install_bootc/microshift-install-rhel-image-mode.adoc#microshift-install-rhel-image-mode[Using image mode for RHEL with {microshift-short}] for more information.

[id="microshift-4-18-deprecated-and-removed-features_{context}"]
== Deprecated and removed features
With this release, the CSI snapshot webhook feature available in previous releases is removed. The webhook is replaced by CEL validation rules for snapshot objects.

//NOTE: Do NOT repeat bug fixes already noted in previous version z-streams
[id="microshift-4-18-bug-fixes_{context}"]
== Bug fixes

[discrete]
[id="microshift-4-18-installation-bug-fixes"]
=== Installation
Previously, the greenboot health check marked some healthy Image mode for {op-system-base} systems as unhealthy due to a 300-second timeout, which was insufficient for systems with slow networks. Beginning in {product-title} 4.18, the default greenboot wait timeout has been extended to 600 seconds to provide more time to download images and ensure accurate system checks.
