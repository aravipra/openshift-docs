= Control permissions with security context constraints

You can use security context constraints (SCCs) to control permissions for the pods in your cluster. These permissions determine the actions that a pod can perform and what resources it can access. You can use SCCs to define a set of conditions that a pod must run with to be accepted into the system.

For more information see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-version}/html/authentication_and_authorization/managing-pod-security-policies[Managing security context constraints].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only RWO volume mounts are supported. SCC could be blocked if pods are not operating with the SCC contexts.
